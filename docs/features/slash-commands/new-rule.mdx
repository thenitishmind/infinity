`/newrule` is a slash command that lets you teach Infinity your preferred way of working. It creates a markdown file in your `.infinityrules` directory that acts like persistent instructions for how Infinity should behave when helping with your projects.

Think of it as setting up house rules that Infinity will always follow, so you don't have to repeat your preferences in every conversation.

#### Using the `/newrule` Slash Command

When you want Infinity to consistently follow certain guidelines:

-   Type `/newrule` in the chat
-   Infinity will help you create a structured rule file by asking about your preferences for:
    -   Communication style (verbose vs. concise)
    -   Development workflows
    -   Coding standards
    -   Project context
    -   Any other specific guidelines
-   You'll review the rule file before it's created
-   Once approved, Infinity creates a markdown file in your `.infinityrules` directory that will automatically be loaded for future conversations

#### Example

I used `/newrule` when I was fed up with repeating the same instructions on every new task. I had specific preferences for how I wanted my React components structured, which testing library to use, and even my preferred variable naming style.

Instead of typing these preferences each time, I just used `/newrule` and worked with Infinity to create a detailed rule file. We built a markdown file that covered everything from code organization to my preference for functional components over class components.

Now whenever I chat with Infinity about my React project, it automatically follows these guidelines without me having to remind it. The best part is that I can create different rule files for different projects, so Infinity adapts to whatever codebase I'm working on.

#### Inspiration

Here's how I use `/newrule` to make my development smoother:

-   I created a rule file for each major project with specific architectural patterns and library preferences, so Infinity always generates code that matches our existing codebase.

-   For my team's shared projects, we have a common rule file that ensures consistent code style and documentation practices regardless of who's using Infinity.

-   When working with legacy code, I made a rule file that reminds Infinity about the quirks and constraints of the old system, so it never suggests modern approaches that won't integrate well.

-   I even have a personal rule file for my side projects with all my opinionated preferences - two-space indentation, arrow functions everywhere, and my exact folder structure requirements.
